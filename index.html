  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This project tested my knowledge of everything learned throughout this semester(as I am sure is the goal). I very much enjoyed working on it, and testing multiple colorations and setups for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feedback I received on my first version was that my articles were difficult to read based on the colors I had selected, and after I suggested adding a slideshow to the home page, they said that was a good addition. I adjusted the article text color, and added said slideshow using the cycle JavaScript plugin.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that I did well stepping out of my comfort zone to look up extra ways to style CSS. I got behind for a good portion of the class, and had to work very diligently to make up for lost time. I would obviously prefer to not get behind in class, and would definitely work harder to prevent that if I had to do it over again.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, I had a blast with this class. I knew absolutely nothing about coding beforehand, and it was awesome to learn everything. The thing I hear constantly about all the frustrating errors over one small typo were absolutely true.

  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a method of creating websites without having to worry about what specific browser people are accessing them from.
  Using three layers(HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), web developers can provide the content requested by users at any level required.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTML makes up the content of the site, which older or more restrictive browsers can access easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS is what makes website more visually appealing, and creates a better looking site for people.
  </p>
  <p>
    JavaScript is the final layer, which gives enhanced usability to those who are capable of using it.
  </p>
  <p>
    These layers together make it so that no matter what your restrictions are, you can view the site.
    This is extremely important today because people are accessing the web from many different devices and browsers.
    Providing content to everyone who desires to see it is one of the main goals of web development, making progressive enhancement a wonderful way to do so.
